 * @param {bigNumber} gasPrice gas price for the transaction in WEI (as an instance of bigNumber), defaults to 9000000000 (9 GWEI)
 * @param {bigNumber} gasLimit gas limit for the transaction (as an instance of bigNumber), defaults to 21000
 * @param {number} nonce the nonce to use for the transaction (as a number)
 * @param {string} to the address to which to the transaction is sent
 * @param {bigNumber} value the value of the transaction in WEI (as an instance of bigNumber), defaults to 1
 * @param {string} inputData data appended to the transaction (as a `hex` string)
 *
 * All the above params are sent in as props of an object.
